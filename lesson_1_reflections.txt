How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It found automatically all the differences. I could focus only on
    them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easier find bugs in code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automaticall saving helps in case of sudden computer closing
    (when energy is down etc.). But if document is saved automatically
    it can be saved with a bug and it will be useless version. Also
    automaticall save probably won't be very logical - it would be
    saved after some random work made.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is calibrated for big, complex projects while google docs
    on small and short work.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git diff gives me possibility to find differences between two
    versions of a file. git log gives me possibility to see the history
    of all commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can easilly go back to working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For making versions of my projects.
