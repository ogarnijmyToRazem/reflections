When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Everytime - it's saffier to have them not only on my computer but also in a cloud. Especially with bigger projects
With many contributors it's good to have the project online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because on my remote repository can work many people and maybe some of
their commits are not what I want in my project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

We make branches when we want to make independent changes in code that
after all we may want to merge. We use clones to have our own local
copy of some repository. We use forks when we want to have our own
GitHub copy of some repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

One can reach it even if doesn't have access to the internet.
