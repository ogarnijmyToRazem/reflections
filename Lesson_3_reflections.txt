When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Everytime - it's saffier to have them not only on my computer but also in a cloud. Especially with bigger projects
With many contributors it's good to have the project online.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because on my remote repository can work many people and maybe some of
their commits are not what I want in my project.
