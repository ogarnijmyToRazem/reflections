What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I think that repository is created. I need to do it to make commits
and other stuff.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate stage before making a commit.
There are only things that I want to add while in working directory
are all files from a project. Staging area makes it possible to make
a commit only on those files that I want to change. So the change
will be easier to describe and understand.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add there updates connected with one logical change, commit them,
then add another updates connected with different logical change,
commit them and so on.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

They would help if I want to experiment or make a new feature that I'm
not sure yet if it will work.
