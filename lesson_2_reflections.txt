What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I think that repository is created. I need to do it to make commits
and other stuff.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is intermediate stage before making a commit.
There are only things that I want to add while in working directory
are all files from a project. Staging area makes it possible to make
a commit only on those files that I want to change. So the change
will be easier to describe and understand.
